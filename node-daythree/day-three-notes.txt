Angular: Client Side JavaScript Framework

NodeJS: Server Side JavaScript Framework

	- NodeJS provides runtime environment to JavaScript.
	- NodeJS works in asynchronous approach (non-blocking approach).
	- NodeJS helps in communicating with File System, Network, Database, API etc.
	- NodeJS has very strong modules integration that helps in backend activities.
	
package.json

	- This file contains all the meta information about your project along with list of depedencies that you use in your project.
	
	npm init
	npm init --yes
	
	npm start (checks the start script in package.json)

Asynchronous and Synchronous Approach

Synchronous: happens at the same time.
Asynchronous: doesn't happens at the same time.

With Synchronous, response is immediate or until it is ready.
With Asynchronous, response as ready. (Partial response is expected)

Synchronous is also known as Blocking Approach.
Asynchronous is also known as Non-Blocking Approach.

In Node, the approach is asynchronous or non-blocking by default.
